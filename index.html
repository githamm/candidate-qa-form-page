                <h1>Denver Post Candidate Questionnaire</h1>
                <h3>Denver City Council</h3>
                <p>In an effort to provide Denver voters with information about City Council candidates, The Denver Post is asking all candidates to complete this candidate questionnaire. The Post will publish candidates' responses on its website in coming weeks, as part of coverage that includes stories about each council district. Your answers also will give reporters more insight into each campaign and the issues affecting the district.</p>
                <p class="bold-text">Deadline: Please complete and submit the questionnaire, and upload a portrait photo of the candidate for use in The Post's coverage, by Friday, March 20.</p>                
                <p>If you don't want to complete the entire questionnaire all at once, <a href="#" data-reveal-id="myModal">click here for the list of questions</a>. You can copy them and write your answers in a document and then copy and paste your answers into this form.
                    <div id="myModal" class="reveal-modal" data-reveal aria-labelledby="modalTitle" aria-hidden="true" role="dialog">
                      <p>Why are you running for City Council?</p>
                      <p>What is the biggest challenge affecting your district, and what would you do as a council member to help resolve it?</p>
                      <p>Briefly describe two other issues in your district that you would work on as a council member.</p>
                      <p>As its population grows, Denver must deal with increased traffic congestion and scarcer parking. How would you approach challenges associated with new development?</p>
                      <p>Denver's policies to address homelessness have focused on two approaches: expanding support services, on the one hand, and passing restrictions or bans on panhandling and camping in public spaces. How should Denver address the issue in the future?</p>
                      <p>Do you support the city's use, and possible expansion, of red-light cameras and photo speeding enforcement?</p>
                      <p>If elected, would you accept or return raises that will increase council members' salaries to $87,623 in July and to $91,915 a year later, a total 10.3 percent increase?</p>
                      <p>Do you think the police reforms that Chief Robert White has implemented have worked, or is there more to be done?</p>
                      <p>Denver's new downtown jail has faced enormous challenges, including cases of inmate abuse. What role should the council play in fixing problems in jail management?</p>
                      <p>Do you support the city's plan to pay for the bulk of the National Western Center plan by extending lodging and car rental taxes? If not, what other options should the city pursue?</p>
                      <p>What do you see as Mayor Michael Hancock's greatest strength and greatest weakness?</p>
                      <p>Should Denver's civil service employees be granted collective bargaining rights, or do you support the city's current employment system?</p>
                      <p>Are Denver's regulations on sales of recreational marijuana working? If not, what actions by the city would you support?</p>
                      <p>Should Denver allow public consumption of marijuana, either fully or with restrictions?</p>
                      <p>Should Denver ban tobacco smoking outdoors along the 16th Street Mall or in city parks?</p>
                      <p>When it comes to the city's budget, how would you change current spending priorities for city services?</p>
